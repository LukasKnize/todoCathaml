# Todo list application

This repository is a source code for website application that manage TODO lists with completable tasks. The application communicates with [Morsmordre](https://morsmordre.cajthaml.eu/docs/) API (in stage two). 

This project serves to bring students closer to what projects look like in practice and normal life and how to work with Git services.

You can find online (compiled) version [here](https://4-mvop-wbf-todolist.cajthaml.eu), after every push at the main branch the version will be updated.


## Contributing

If a student wants to contribute (ie. has to), every change needs to be documented in issues. Each issue will need to have one branch called by its id and name (shortened), for example, `304-https-fix` and for the one issue, there needs to be a pull request (from this branch to the main one), which will be approved by a teacher. 

The whole application, including comments, has to be in the English language. The code must be optimized and formatted in the correct way (4 spaces for tab, ...). 

For any info, contact other students / teacher at the SSPŠaG Cajthaml Discord server, in channel Webový frontend (4) > #pomoc!
